# About the project

This project was a challenge proposed by HP for Hack Upc2023.

The goal of the project is to develop a forecasting system to optimize inventory management. By accurately predicting future demand, the system can help optimize inventory levels, reduce costs, and improve overall supply chain efficiency.


## Structure

The folder structure is as follows:
```
    HP
    ├── checkpoints
    ├── Datasets
    ├── init.py
    ├── nb
    ├── src
    ├── submissions
    ├── Visualització
    ├── web
```
- The "checkpoints" folder contains trained models.
- The "nb" folder contains notebooks where we performed data exploration, analysis, and training of machine learning models.
- The "src" folder contains the deep learning structure.
- The "Datasets" folder contains the datasets generated after data cleaning.
- Finally, the "web" and "Visualització" folders contain the project demo.

Each folder is properly documented with README files to reproduce the results.
